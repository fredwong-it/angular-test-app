<h2>Front End Objective</h2>
<p>
    Create a single page Angular 4+ app with simple routing that has one state/view. In it, place two buttons that when clicked; show a tooltip above the button with some text in it.
    When button A is clicked, if button Bâ€™s tooltip is open it should close and vice versa - only one tooltip should be visible at a time. Either tooltip should close when clicked anywhere outside of it, but remain open if clicked inside. Either tooltip should close when ESC key is pressed.
</p>


<h4>Implementation</h4>

    Tooltip functionality should be written as a reusable component

<p>
    You can organize the files/folders in any way
</p>
<p>
    The reviewer should be able to run your solution with a simple npm command
